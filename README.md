# ðŸ”‹ BatteryAlert

BatteryAlert is a PowerShell script that helps you manage your laptop battery health by notifying you when the battery is low at 30% or fully charged at 80%.


## âœ” Why it's Recommended to charge at 80% and discharge at 30% laptop battery?

Maintaining a charge between 30% and 80% is endorsed by most laptop manufacturers as it contributes to prolonged battery lifespan, minimizing unexpected shutdowns, and optimizing long-term performance.
